# Beta Bank Supervised Learning ML Project

In this project, I will be testing my skills in Supervised Learning by:
    
- Working with new evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score and AUC-ROC.
- Adjusting class weights, downsample, upsample, and tune thresholds for classification tasks.
- Evaluating a modelâ€™s quality using R2 and MAE metrics in the regression tasks.

The overall goal of this project is to pick up new metrics for evaluating machine learning models performance. 
I've learned how to tune machine learning models and improve these metrics.

I use the sklearn library with several modules as well as the pandas library.
